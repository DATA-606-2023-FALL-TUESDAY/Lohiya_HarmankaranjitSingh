## 2. Background


The integration of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, into medical diagnostics has revolutionized disease identification through the digitalization of medical imaging methods. Deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in automatically identifying complex patterns in medical images, enabling tasks like lesion identification and parts delineation. Some notable studies have showcased deep learning's potential to outperform human experts in skin malignancy and chest CT scan analysis. This advancement holds promise for enhancing diagnostic precision and cost-effectiveness, as well as expediting patient care. However, challenges remain, including concerns about data security and the interpretability of deep learning algorithms, which need to be addressed for their successful integration into healthcare assessments.

### Now, why does it matter?

A quick and precise assessment could mean what separates death and life in the complex world of healthcare. While successful, conventional diagnostic techniques frequently rely on the knowledge of medical experts and can occasionally be flawed by mistakes made by individuals. Additionally, there is a pressing demand for automated, effective, and exact methods of diagnosis given the expanding amount of health information. With its aptitude for managing huge data sets 
and generating insightful conclusions, artificial intelligence presents a viable answer to these problems. The process of diagnosis might be revolutionized by using deep learning algorithms, assuring early identification and intervention, which may substantially enhance the health of patients and reduce healthcare expenses.


### Research Questions:

1. What can be done to improve the precision and effectiveness of illness detection from medical images using deep learning techniques, particularly CNNs?
2. What current issues in medical diagnostics need to be addressed, and how may deep learning help?
3. What steps can we take to make sure that healthcare practitioners can understand and justify the predictions that deep learning models make?
4. How will integrating deep learning techniques affect the whole healthcare system, particularly in terms of patient outcomes and treatment effectiveness?

###  Aim of the Research Project and Definition of Objectives:

1. To improve the precision and accuracy of disease diagnosis from medical imagery. 
2. To reduce the time taken to diagnose diseases, enabling timely interventions. 
3. To study state-of-the-art approaches of AI techniques. 
4. To develop a model that can be fine-tuned or adapted to diagnose a variety of diseases or conditions. 
5. To ensure that the model's predictions can be understood and rationalized by healthcare professionals.

## 3. Data 

**Describe the datasets you are using to answer your research questions.**

- Data sources: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/
- Data size: 2 GB
- Data shape: Image-JPEG
 


### **Dataset Features**

- The accuracy and usefulness of the training data have a considerable impact on the effectiveness of the algorithm, particularly in medical diagnoses. The raw data set used in this study is thoroughly examined in the following section with an emphasis on its source, size, framework, and quality. Understanding the peculiarities of the information set guarantees the framework's construction and assessment stages are tackled with clarity and precision.

- Diverse data in the vast area of healthcare imaging make it easier to conduct research, particularly for advanced machine learning applications. Chest X-ray scans have been selected as the specific sample for this investigation. Images from the dataset are divided into two main groups: normal and pneumonia. Given the frequency and importance of pneumonia identification, this set of data is very pertinent to the goals of the study.

- The data set's arrangement is rather simple. Each photo has a caption stating that it depicts a normal condition or a pneumonia condition because there are two distinct types. As a result, each entry in the collection comprises of an image and its associated label.

- This dataset contains photos and descriptions that were gathered between the years 2010 and 2020 and span a decade. Due to the wide range of disease trends and developments throughout this long period of time, an adequate sample of patients is ensured.

- The dataset's entries and rows each refer to a particular chest X-ray picture. There is a label next to the image stating whether it belongs in the "normal" category or the "pneumonia" category
